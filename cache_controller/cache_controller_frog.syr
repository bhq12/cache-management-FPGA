WARNING:Xst:819 - "//file/usersb$/bhq12/home/cache-management-FPGA/cache_controller/cache_controller_frog.vhd" line 64: One or more signals are missing in the process sensitivity list. To enable synthesis of FPGA/CPLD hardware, XST will assume that all necessary signals are present in the sensitivity list. Please note that the result of the synthesis may differ from the initial design specification. The missing signals are:
   <operation>, <address_in>, <data_in>, <data_from_cache>, <data_from_memory>, <hm>, <read_ready>
Entity <cache_controller_frog> analyzed. Unit <cache_controller_frog> generated.

WARNING:Xst:647 - Input <clk> is never used. This port will be preserved and left unconnected if it belongs to a top-level block or it belongs to a sub-block and the hierarchy of this sub-block is preserved.
WARNING:Xst:647 - Input <data_from_cache> is never used. This port will be preserved and left unconnected if it belongs to a top-level block or it belongs to a sub-block and the hierarchy of this sub-block is preserved.
INFO:Xst:1608 - Relative priorities of control signals on register <ec> differ from those commonly found in the selected device family. This will result in additional logic around the register.
WARNING:Xst:737 - Found 1-bit latch for signal <ec>. Latches may be generated from incomplete case or if statements. We do not recommend the use of latches in FPGA/CPLD designs, as they may lead to timing problems.

INFO:Xst:2371 - HDL ADVISOR - Logic functions respectively driving the data and gate enable inputs of this latch share common terms. This situation will potentially lead to setup/hold violations and, as a result, to simulation problems. This situation may come from an incomplete case statement (all selector values are not covered). You should carefully review if it was in your intentions to describe such a latch.
